# Development Setup Issues Fixed

## ‚úÖ Issues Resolved

1. **Sentry Configuration Migration**: Moved from separate config files to `instrumentation.ts`
2. **Environment Variables**: Created `.env.local` with development-friendly values
3. **Crypto Module Resolution**: Fixed Node.js crypto import in `lib/gemini.ts`
4. **Supabase Configuration**: Made more resilient to handle missing credentials
5. **TypeScript Errors**: All 132 TypeScript errors resolved (from previous session)

## üîß Current Status

The development server should now start without the previous errors. However, you may still encounter some runtime issues due to:

1. **Database Connection**: The app expects a PostgreSQL database for Better Auth
2. **Supabase Setup**: For full functionality, you need a real Supabase project
3. **API Keys**: Trading features require valid Alpaca/Gemini API keys

## üöÄ Quick Start Options

### Environment Validation

Before starting development, validate your environment setup:

```bash
# Validate all required environment variables
npm run validate-env

# Run full setup check (environment + TypeScript)
npm run setup:check
```

### Option 1: Development with Mock Data
The current `.env.local` has mock values that should allow the server to start. Some features may not work but the UI should load.

### Option 2: Set Up Real Services
1. **Supabase**: Create a project at https://supabase.com
2. **PostgreSQL**: Set up a local database for Better Auth
3. **Alpaca**: Get paper trading keys from https://alpaca.markets
4. **Gemini**: Get sandbox API keys from https://gemini.com

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Validate Environment**: `npm run validate-env`
2. **Start Development Server**: `npm run dev`
3. **Production Deployment**: See [`DEPLOYMENT_SETUP.md`](./DEPLOYMENT_SETUP.md) for CI/CD setup
4. **Full Functionality**: Set up real services for complete features

## üêõ Common Issues

- **500 Errors**: Normal when using mock credentials
- **Database Connection Warnings**: Expected without real PostgreSQL setup
- **API Warnings**: Expected without real trading API keys

The important thing is that the server starts and TypeScript compiles without errors.
